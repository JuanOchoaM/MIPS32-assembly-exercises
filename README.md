# Computer Assembly Exercises

This repository contains a collection of computer architecture exercises written in assembly language using QTSPIM.

## Files and Descriptions

- **countPositive.s**: This program counts the number of positive integers in an array.
- **countNegative.s**: This program counts the number of negative integers in an array.
- **simpleLoopAdd.s**: This program demonstrates a simple loop and addition in MIPS assembly.
- **factorial.s**: This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.
- **compareArrays.s**: This program compares elements of two arrays `A` and `B`, counting how many times elements in `B` are greater than those in `A`, and prints the count.
- **subtractArrays.s**: This program subtracts elements of array `B` from array `A`, stores the results in array `C`, and then prints the elements of `C`.
- **compareFloats.s**: This program compares two floating-point numbers, `float1` and `float2`, and prints “Result is: 1” if `float1` is less than `float2`, otherwise it prints “Result is: 0”.
- **findMax.s**: This program finds the largest value in array `A` and prints it with the message “The largest value in the array is: “.
- **floatDifference.s**: This program prompts the user to enter six floating-point values, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, and prints the result.
- **swapAddFloats.s**: This program compares two floating-point numbers, swaps their values if the first is less than the second, adds the two numbers, and prints the result.
- **positiveCounter.s**: This program counts the number of positive integers in an array.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need QTSPIM, a simulator for the MIPS architecture. You can download it from [here](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

### Running the Programs

1. Open QTSPIM.
2. Load the desired assembly file (`.s`).
3. Run the program using the simulator controls.
